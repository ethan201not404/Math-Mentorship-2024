# Math Mentorship Program: January – May 2024

The Math Mentorship Program at the University of Toronto is designed for high school students with considerable academic promise who are interested in learning more about research in the Department of Mathematics.

## Program Overview

The goal of the Math Mentorship Program is to:
- Support and enhance exceptional academic abilities.
- Expose students to the work of the Department of Mathematics’ faculty and graduate students.
- Provide students with the opportunity to become directly involved in mathematics.
- Require each student to create and present a research poster project by the end of the program.

## Research Project Structure

During the program, mentees and mentor will:
- Work on and discuss various topics in mathematics.
- Develop a research poster on a single problem or topic.
- Engage in independent work and reading, returning to mentors with questions.

Mentors will assist mentees in developing their goals by providing knowledge, advice, and resources. At the closing ceremony, mentees will present their research projects to the group.


## My Research Topic
My research topic is **Integer Partitions, Insights from Discrete Mathematics**.

I would like to extend huge thanks to my mentor, [Claire Zhao](contact.zhao@mail.utoronto.ca), University of Toronto, for his guidance and mentorship!

I used the [LaTex](latex/integer-partitions.tex) for generating the PDF file and the Python [Manim](manim) library (taught by Claire) for creating mathematical animations.
