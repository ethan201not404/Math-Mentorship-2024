## Research Project Structure

During the program, you and your mentor will:
- Work on and discuss various topics in mathematics.
- Develop a research poster on a single problem or topic.
- Engage in independent work and reading, returning to mentors with questions.

Mentors will assist mentees in developing their goals by providing knowledge, advice, and resources. At the closing ceremony, mentees will present their research projects to the group.

## My Reasearch Topic
My research topic is Integer Partitions. 
I would like to extend huge thanks to my mentor, Claire Zhao, for her guidance and mentorship!
